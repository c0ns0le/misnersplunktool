Misner Splunk Tool
==================

Misner Splunk Tool v2017.07.26  
by Joe Misner  
http://tools.misner.net/  

Misner Splunk Tool connects to a Splunk Enterprise or Universal
Forwarder instance via REST API, retrieving the instance's
configurations, input status, apps, and other useful information for
troubleshooting and analysis. This tool's intention is to grant easy
access into remote Splunk instances where shell or web access may not
be available, but the splunkd management port (default 8089) is
accessible.

Edit the included file misnersplunktool.conf located in this
application's directory to specify configurations such as default
hosts, credentials, and REST endpoints. If this file is missing,
navigate to 'File > Build misnersplunktool.conf' and edit this file
with a text editor.

Tooltips have been setup throughout the tool. For additional help,
hover your mouse pointer over different areas of the tool's interface
for more information.



Building
--------

The following dependencies are required to build the application:
- Misner Splunk Tool source
- Python v2.7.13, https://www.python.org/
- Inno Setup v5.5.9, http://www.jrsoftware.org/
- Python module 'PyInstaller' v3.2.1, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyInstaller
- Python module 'PySide' v1.2.4, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySide
- Python package 'requests' v2.9.1, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests
- Python module 'splunk-sdk' v1.6.0, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/splunk-sdk

1. In a Command Prompt window, change to the directory containing this git project, for example:
```
cd c:\misnersplunktool\
```

2. Convert the PySide graphical user interface file `misnersplunktool.ui` into Python:
```
c:\Python27\Scripts\pyside-uic.exe -x misnersplunktool.ui -o misnersplunktoolui.py
```
  * Assumption is that Python 2.7 is installed in `c:\Python27\`

3. Package the project with all dependencies using PyInstaller:
```
c:\Python27\python.exe -O c:\Python27\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe misnersplunktool.spec -y
```
  * Assumption is that Python 2.7 is installed in `c:\Python27\`
  * Resulting package will be stored in the subdirectory `dist\Misner Splunk Tool\`

4. Compile the PyInstaller package into an installer executable using Inno Setup:
```
"c:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5\iscc.exe" innosetup.iss
```
  * Assumption is that Inno Setup 5 is installed in `c:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5\`

5. Resulting installer executable in the format `Setup_MisnerSplunkTool_xxxxxxxx.exe` is created.
